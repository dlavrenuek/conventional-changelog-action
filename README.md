# Generic Conventional Changelog GitHub Action

<a href="https://github.com/dlavrenuek/conventional-changelog-action/actions"><img alt="javscript-action status" src="https://github.com/dlavrenuek/conventional-changelog-action/workflows/development/badge.svg"></a>

This GitHub action generates a changelog from git history using conventional commits without any other
requirements on your project versioning or labeling. It is intended to be used with other actions to make use of the
generated changelog.

## Example Usage

This example generates a changelog from the tag `v1.0.0` to HEAD

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0

  - uses: dlavrenuek/conventional-changelog-action@v1.1.0
    id: changelog
    with:
      from: v1.0.0
      to: HEAD
```

The changelog can be accessed in other steps by `${{ steps.changelog.outputs.body }}`
